## Personnel Requirements

1x Person to play the Game Master who runs NPC interactions and the story

1x People (plus 0 to 5 more people) to fill the squad of player characters

We recommend a minimum of 3 for role dispersal and play synergy but the system can work with as few as 1 persons playing.

## Physical Requirements

This game requires a set of polyhedral dice (1x d4, 1x d6, 1x d8, 1x d10, 1x d12 and 1x d20) a character sheet per player \[link to be made\] (scannable copies of character sheets are available in the appendix), and this book for reference purposes.

Additionally you may want access to The Book of Evil and Disposable Minions for enemy stat blocks (some examples are in the appendix of this book, but it might not be enough if you don’t prepare and produce more of your own). Also it is recommended to take notes during play so as not to forget details during a following play session.

If you don’t have a full set of polyhedral dice check the section on Alternative Play Methods in the Appendix.

## Time Requirements

45 minutes to 2 hours

## Prep

### Campaign Prep

A lot of play groups will have a Session 0 where they discuss the setting and plans for characters and do very little actual playing the game. Both before and after this this rulebook recommends preparing the following elements to make per-session Prep easier.

If you don't think you need help with this process because you're a veteran or think you know better? Feel free to disregard this section.

#### Before Session 0

Pick a style of villain and if there's an organization or a bunch of independent agents racing to seek the same goal.

Pick if the players have the same origin or are independents that form a coalition under a common goal.

Pick the setting (will it be the setting described in this book or something of your own creation)

#### After Session 0

How to introduce the character's to one another

Find solution for if player character's are spread over a substantial age gap or don’t have much of an overlap in daytime activities for them to meetup and discuss strategy before the Intrusion phase.

### Session Prep

Pick a villain for the session, either from the The Book of Evil and Disposable Minions or from the villain table in the appendix. If the villain has an ability that affects the real world, read the details so you have consistent descriptions for the players.

Pick a plan of attack from the Appendix table for villainous schemes based on villain style.

Pick which of the player’s daytime activity will intersect with the villain's plan and write yourself a blurb on that scene.

### One-Shot Prep

If you're just going to run a stand alone session (known as a one-shot) this rulebook recommends handwaving any backstory requirements between the players as getting to the game quickly is the aim.

Pick a villain from the session and read their details and plan an In Media Res opening to set the scene for the game’s start.
