# Character Details

## Primary Details of a Character

Each character will need the following details to be decided during creation, you can read up on these details further in this section:

**Name**

**Age**

**Class**

**Stats**

**Skills**

**Daytime Activities**

**Curiosity**

**Daimsel**

## Name

Both Base Form and the magical form need names

## Age

Character age fits into broad categories, character age has no mechanical effects and is more for roleplaying purposes and justifying character skills.

_Underage_ (less than 18 or graduating secondary education)

_Supported Adult_ (18+ however long it takes to complete tertiary education)

_Independent Adult_ (18+ but you have a full time job)

_Tethered Adult_ (16+ you are tethered by responsibility to some family member)

## Class

This rulebook does note that character classes are technically not necessary as you can take any spell or action provided you meet the stat requirements for it. But to aid in character builds we have some pre-configured arrangements we think work well.

## Stats

There are 5 primary stats:

**Physique**

**Adroit**

**Gumption**

**Empathy**

**Attunement**

These 5 form the backbone of each character, each of the first 4 has a mental and physical component, but you can read about that in more detail below:

### Physique

The ability to have rippling pecs and know them to each ripple. Physique is both the character's quality of their body and their familiarity with it. A character with low Physique might not be able to crush a tomato with their bare hands, but they themselves also aren't aware if it's within their capabilities. A high physique character would certainly have greater physical Potential, but they also know where their limits are, what the cost is for going beyond them and how to aid on their own recovery afterwards.

Used for: challenges overcome by brute force, recovery, overcoming contrivances affecting the character's body.

### Adroit

The ability to think outside the box and escape from it. Adroit is both a character's mental and physical flexibility or maneuverability. A character with low Adroit would have trouble dodging enemy attacks, or escaping from magical prisons. A character with high adroit would be difficult to pin down in any circumstance and would have the mental flexibility to intuit the rules a contrivance had applied over a space from seeing it in action.

Used for: challenges overcome by dexterity, dodging, overcoming contrivances restricting movement or thought, escaping bondage.

### Gumption

The ability to stand firm, both literally and mentally. Gumption is both a character's mental and physical fortitude and resistance to assault. A character with low Gumption would start fights with a lower Poise and be unable to resist mental assaults or distressing scenarios. A character with high Gumption would start a fight with bonus Poise and be able to aid other characters with recovering or resisting mental assaults.

Used for: Challenges where one must overcome pain, working within the confines of a contrivance, resisting Poise damage, aiding other characters in recovering faster.

### Empathy

The ability to handle both your feelings and those of others. Empathy is both a character’s ability to express their own feelings and those of others. A character with low Empathy would be vulnerable to mind control and unable to spot a traitor or character with ill intentions or a secret. A character with high Empathy would be able to express emotions of themselves and those around them directly into the minds of other characters and resist attempts of others on themselves.

Used for: Challenges where morals are questioned, expressing your praxis to turn enemies to allies, non-sidereal magic, boosting the powers of other characters.

### Attunement

The ability to experience the sidereal both by sensing it and influencing it. Attunement is both a character's defense and offense with the Sidereal. A character with low Attunement wouldn’t have access to very strong spells and wouldn’t be able to sense a contrivance until they are within it. A character with high Attunement would be able to transform without a **Catchcry** and have the ability to affect an ongoing contrivance.

Used for: Challenges involving transformation, spellcasting, sensing contrivances from afar.

## Stat Spread

The default spread when doing character creation is to have all your stats add up to 10, with each stat being no lower than 1.

See the appendix for other approaches.

## Skills

There's no set skills list, instead: in concert with the Game Master, pick a spread of skills or hobbies that match four of the following restrictions:

Something the character learned because:

- They were forced to
- They were curious
- They had "innate" talent in
- Their dream job would require
- They got into because of a crush
- They learned from a friend
- Of spite

Any time the character is doing a skill challenge a player can attempt to convince the Game Master to let them treat the relevant stat as 1 higher if one of the above skills would offer some advantage.

## Daytime Activities

Each player character has a life, and as such has something they’re normally doing during the day that would put them in a position to either be exposed to contrivances or the victims there of. \[needs more details\]

If you’re not sure what to have as a daytime activity try either picking something from the below table or roll a d8.

| Result | Activity                                                                    |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1      | School (either as student or staff)                                         |
| 2      | Office job                                                                  |
| 3      | Courier job                                                                 |
| 4      | Socializing                                                                 |
| 5      | Living off Ill-gotten gains                                                 |
| 6      | Fulfilling quota for government grant                                       |
| 7      | Service job                                                                 |
| 8      | Cease to exist, only to come into being when the people cry out to be saved |

## Curiosity

An odd detail about your character, this should be used as a way of forcing a character into a daytime activity they normally wouldn’t due to their age or for character building. \[needs more details\]

## Damsel

An NPC the characters is good friends with who somehow, due to being gullible or kind-hearted, ends up embroiled in villainous plots quicker than someone actively hunting them down.

This NPC just needs a name and a brief bio on how they often get into trouble.

If several of the player characters have a common daytime activity they can share a Damsel. \[needs more details\]

## Transformations

Each player, being some style of magical girl, has access to several transformations. There are 3 stages to this:

### Base Form

This is the character's civilian appearance, they have little to no access to their magical powers and have no protection on their identity.

### Magical Form

This is the primary form that can access their additional powers, the character is technically indestructible in this form, but can be beaten in a **Fight**. To access this form a character needs to be able to strike a pose and shout a **catch cry**, if they can't do either they need to pass an Attunement Challenge (see character Challenges for more details).

### Crisis Form

This is the ultimate form of a magical girl, but has serious drawbacks to its use and activation. It can only be accessed if the character is already in their magical form and someone they care about is in mortal danger (this can include innocent civilians if the player wants). The main feature of the crisis form is to remove the mortal threat placed on other characters and place it on themselves instead. This is up to the Game Master’s discretion but while in the presence of a magical girl in their Crisis Form, no mortal harm can befall anyone under their protection.

### Catchcry

"Starkly Coruscant Transformation Sequence!!"

A catchcry is an important part of any transformation, functionally it may seem pointless as it must only serve to draw attention to one's self. But the purpose is actually to steel the mind and prepare the body for the wild magic's about to rend it immutable to harm.

This rulebook doesn't require the players to have related catchcries for their transformation, but does recommend them sharing a theme or structure.

Characters that are attempting to transform without shouting their catchcry must make an Attunement Challenge and beat 15 minus their attunement score or a skill challenge to the Game Master’s discretion.
