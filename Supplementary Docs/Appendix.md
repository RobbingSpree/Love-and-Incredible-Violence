## TTRPG
Tabletop Role Playing Game, a style of game where the system and rules are entirely governed by the players rather than some mechanism or a computer.

## Daily Life
The catch all for non-combat and non-investigation activities the players engage in with their characters including improvising scenes and exploring character relationships so they can set up details the GM can use in later sessions.
