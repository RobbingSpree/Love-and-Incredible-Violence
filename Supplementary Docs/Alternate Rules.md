## Alternate rules

Stat choice by dice roll

Pick an order for the character's stats. Roll 1d6. Take 1 from the result, but if the result would be lower than 1 set it to 1.

For the second stat it would be 1d6-2, for the 3rd 1d6-3 and so on.

It is the Game Master's discretion if the player gets any opportunity for re-rolls of tragic results of this method.

Character creation by dice result

Use the following tables to decide class, age, daytime activity and pastimes. Then use the above rules for stat choice by dice roll to get the character's stats.

Class (if more classes are added to the game this table will extend)

\[Table missing as class development still in progress\]

Age

## Wasting Time

When thinking about how to handle skill challenge failures consider how much a person would need to forget to actually fail at doing that task. For instance most people have the muscle memory to perform small jumps without having to think about much more than where they jump from. For a player to believe their character that routinely leaps between power poles would suddenly just fail to perform acrobatics on the same scale it may ruin their immersion.

Instead consider wasting their time instead.

Since contrivances are a core part of the setting it wouldnâ€™t be immersion breaking to add in distractions if a player rolls low on a skill challenge. While leaping up a building they spot someone fending off a home invader or an abusive partner, the challenge becomes if the character would ignore this mundane threat to focus solely on the magical one knowing that time is of the essence.

This makes the challenge more of a choice for the player if they fail it. If they choose to not intervene then now NPCs have seen the heroes choose to not aid some citizens and this can come back to haunt them in future sessions.

A success in this situation could include the same distracting scenario, but they are given a chance to very swifty address it to further the side plot that these skill checks open up to the story.
