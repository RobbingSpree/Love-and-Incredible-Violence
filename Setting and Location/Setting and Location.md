## Location

The default setting for this game system is that of the Azule-Juban. A very dense urban cityscape, filled with shops, storage warehouses, schools, a local radio station, a university, several parks and condemned buildings and a local hospital. Essentially every setting you'd need without having to plan or implement long distance travel into the game. Regardless of the settings point in time you can normally justify any odd contrivance with municipal cummugery, why do they have a local radio station? It's probably ran by the university so the students have hands on with the tech.

This setting is designed so contrivances of the plot seem reasonable, want the villain of the week to be able to fall back from a store front into an abandoned warehouse? Sure, it's there. A dense urban environment is often a bit too full of hidden details that locals would know every street, but if the players ask why there's such a glut of buildings the local council won't kick a stink about your players destroying then it can be a part of the villain's plan of urban decay to induce a feeling of ennui in the locals that they can harvest as needed to fuel their machinations.

The players are assumed to be locals to this area (due to the all hours crime fighting they'll be taking part in), as such in the backgrounds section of Character Details we have some suggestions on what the players situation is for living in this part of town.

## The Sidereal

The Sidereal is an ironic force of seemingly magic nature, it impacts the real world with contrivances: where something that seems very unlikely happens due to the poetic justice of it all. A businessman is criticized for their choices by their rivals and yet with the influence of the Sidereal the circumstances contrive to let the businessman continue and be seemingly rewarded by fate for their choices, even if they’re making all the wrong choices, because from the perspective of the some agent of the Sidereal it’s poetic.

There are some creatures native to the Sidereal, they have no real stake in the goings on of the real world. They act detached only taking an interest in things that seem like it might be fun, or it plays into one of their ongoing schemes.

The reason the Sidereal seems to attract the attention of those who would use it for good or ill is its ability to allow the seemingly impossible to happen. By developing a sense for it one can channel the Sidereal to seemingly do magic, provided it follows some rules.

## History of Magical Girls

For as long as people have gathered in communities some form of Magical Girl has sprung forth, seemingly in response to existential threats posed to their community.

There's no set age or body type of a magical girl, but their magical form often leans toward what capabilities comes naturally to them, a swift runner leads to a Magical Girl with powerful legs capable of bending steel with a kick, an analytical thinker leads to a Magical Girl with dominion over their most aligned element.

Magical Girl is a catch all term, there have been male Magical Girls through history. The previous term: Magical Child was more encompassing but when a team of young teenage girls a decade ago was the most recent notable example of the hero the common term changed to better reflect what people thought of first when discussing heroic exploits.

If the above blurb does not suit your playgroup feel free to write your own. It's recommended to draw the line of weather magical girls are known about by the public and if there are notable examples of them in the past or if they are a very recent trend as it makes NPC interactions easier to improv if you know how the general populace would respond to seeing such a character in action.

## The Villains You Will Face

This rulebook advises there be an overarching villain or group for the players to face. It can start as seemingly isolated incidents of people acting against their best interest or suddenly being cartoonishly evil as the evil group learns of the powers of the Sidereal and tests them out before starting their main scheme. The guides in this book advise of a format where the players are essentially fighting a monster of the week each session, this is mostly to keep with the themes of the primary works in the field, but also for game flow reasons.
