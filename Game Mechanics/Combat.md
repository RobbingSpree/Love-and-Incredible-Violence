Combat is done in rounds, each round has every character make an action (stance changing is an action) once their turn arrives. Any players not involved in the combat get a chance to move closer to the fight at the end of each round, once they arrive on the scene at the end of one round they can roll to be put into the turn order.

Combat in this system does not end when one side has their health is reduced to 0, instead; as the characters are clad in sidereal powers that make them mostly indestructible, combat is about knocking down or incapacitating your foe. This is done with a mechanic called Poise, as a character takes hits and is backed into a corner they will lose the ability to fight back. Once a character’s poise is such that they are prone or surrendered a character can use a finishing move to remove that defeated character from the fight.

## Poise

Poise is a character’s ability to continue fighting, related to their stance. As they take hits from the environment or from enemies their poise is reduced, as they strike out at their foe their poise is increased. Poise is essentially a 10 point system, 10 being standing firm, 0 being knocked off your feet, some minions will have more poise than normal according to their stat block, but if their poise drops it won’t increase if it’s above 10 unless they have an ability that says otherwise.

## Stance

If Poise is a measure of how well a character is doing across the entire fight, their stance is how they're going during this turn. There are 3 stances you can choose to be in during your turn and they both represent a characters physical and mental attitude at that moment.

### Wild

This stance is all about aggression and forward movement while in this stance at the end of a round a character will gain one poise. If you started your turn in this stance you're also able to use any one action in your arsenal that requires the Wild stance. The wild stance also forces you to move toward an enemy during your turn.

### Focused

The focused stance is about balance, you try to draw attention towards yourself in the belief that you can take it without repercussion. While in the balanced stance you can't gain or lose more than one (1) poise per round. You also attempt to stay where you are and don't move when forced and gain some resistance to mental or emotional attacks while in this stance.

### Preparing

This stance is about a risk vs reward approach, if you end the round in this stance you lose one (1) poise, but if you start your turn in it you can use any one action in your arsenal that requires the preparing stance If you have started enough turns to meet its requirements (these turns don't need to all be concurrent, but using any action sets your prepared count to 0). This stance doesn't cause you to move anywhere, but any movement effects will always succeed against you.

### Unstanced

There are a few effects that will strip a character of their stance, and follow a rock-paper-siccors weakness triangle. Wild stance actions that hit a character in the Preparing stance will knock them out of it and cause them to lose their stance, Prepared likewise beats the stance off a balanced stance character, and a Balanced character will beat the stance off a Wild one.

There are exceptions, and they will be stated in the effects details of an action.

## Rundown of a Fight

### Starting a Fight

A player character might start a fight for many reasons, this rulebook assumes they’re picking a fight with the forces of evil and not amongst one another. Combat is done with a turn order, decided at the start of combat. The character that initiates combat acts first, all other characters involved roll a d6 to decide where they land in the order. Characters of the same team that roll the same number can freely choose their order between themselves each round. Opposing characters that roll the same, depending on which team started the fight: the starting team will all go first and then the defending team.

Additionally each character of the attacking team gets to pick their starting stance, while the defending team starts in Balanced.

### Acting in a Fight

Fights occur in rounds, any tidy up effects occur between rounds and every character suffering from some ongoing effect gets to make an attempt to break free during this time rather than doing it in their turn.

During each character's turn they have a chance to move and act. Movement is done quite nebulously, there are 4 distance ranges and they are all relative to the main foe being fought.

From closest to furthest the distances are: Adjacent, Nearby, Far, Away

Actions a character can do will have a minimum range that it can be done from, and if the villain spawns Minions or starts the fight with Minions player characters can't move past a distance range that contains any Minions (if the minions move past the players and a distance range becomes empty of minions then players can advance while ignoring the threat behind them).

The Away distance is for characters that have yet to join the fight and can come with several scales of magnitude. If a character is 4 units of Away from the fight then they roll 1d4 dice to see how much closer they get to the fight, if they roll higher than the number of units away from the fight they are they can use the difference between their roll and the units to overcome to move to the Nearby or Adjacent ranges for their turn.

If while following minions out of a fight into the Away distance a player is able to roll higher than the number of units needed to catch up then the Minion is considered defeated and the player is put at the distance the Minion was able to reach and their turn ends.

Actions come in two styles: Basic actions, and Specialized Actions. All players share the same pool of Basic Actions (see the chapter for Actions for what this list contains) and Specialized Actions have specific stat or class restrictions, if an effect temporarily reduces or changes a character's stats it does not prevent them from using those actions.

Every player character can use a single action per round during their turn, if an action has an effect when another character acts, then it will only occur once (even if the character it's triggering from somehow gets two turns in a single round).

Minions will always move to a set distance from the Villain as per the description in the Villain's abilities and move one distance per turn until they reach their destination. Some minions will leave the fight to menace characters not currently present, for instance a Damsel who is involved in this episode's plot and players can leave the fight to pursue them using the same dice roll for units moved mechanic as when trying to join a fight late.

Villains will have a table for how many actions they get to use each turn based on the number of players total (not just players currently involved in the fight), but otherwise have the same restrictions that the players get. If a villain is able to move during a fight they will shift all other characters further or closer one distance, if this moves a character from Far to Away they will not be treated as in range for any of the villain's actions.

### Ending a Fight

A fight can end under two (2) circumstances:

- The villain has their Poise reduced to 0 or all players have their Poise reduced to 0
- The Villain raises their Poise to 10 and the round ends or any player raises their Poise to 10 and uses any action with the Finisher tag

Depending on the details in the Villain's Victory notes there may be little to no ongoing penalty, often the victory notes will include details on how the next episode will change to reflect the Forces of Darkness becoming stronger. But some Villain Victory Notes will include a stat penalty for the following episode or until they are beaten in a subsequent fight.

#### Evil is Victorious

Victory for the Villain of the Week should be roleplayed as a tactical retreat by the player team and a learning experience, the GM is recommended to share details about the Villain's strategy notes and any weaknesses mentioned in their ability descriptions so the players can better arm themselves in a subsequent fight.

Some Villains are designed like a puzzle and it is expected the players will lose a fight against them once or twice before finding a strategy that works, so don't make failure against such a foe seem overwhelming or a sudden tip in the power balance.

#### Victory for the Heroes

When the players win a fight against the forces of darkness, depending on how the overarching plot is being handled this can be a landmark victory as they seize one of a series of Artifacts from their foes, or it can be a run of the mill fight for territory and the moral of the citizenry of the town.

Keep mote of any notable NPCs or players who were kidnapped during the investigation portion of the episode to remark on their release, have fun role playing conversations on how the player's Damsels continue to end up in the clutches of their foes.
