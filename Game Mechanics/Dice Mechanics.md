## Rolling dice

This system uses a scale of power where every extra point you can put into a dice roll has a tangible benefit. When doing a skill check or rolling dice for an ability or spell first you solve for what level you're casting it at, for our example we'll be making a Physique check at level 3.

According to the below table (also found later in the book and in the appendix with more maths details) we'll be rolling all three of the 4-sided, 6-sided, and 8-sided dice tallying up their results and using that as the result of our attempt.

## Dice Level Table

| Level | Dice Used                 | Median Roll | 80% roll range |
| ----- | ------------------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| 1     | d4                        | 2           | 1-4            |
| 2     | d4, d6                    | 6           | 4-8            |
| 3     | d4, d6, d8                | 10          | 7-14           |
| 4     | d4, d6, d8, d10           | 15          | 12-20          |
| 5     | d4, d6, d8, d10, d12      | 21          | 16-29          |
| 6     | d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20 | 31          | 23-43          |

## Setting Challenge Difficulty

As you can see from the above table thereâ€™s very little overlap for the common parts of the dice results, which essentially lets you as the Game Master make soft gates for what level someone would be to make a roll. A Level 3 and a Level 2 are both capable of rolling a 10 or better, but the Level 3 has a much better chance of doing so.
