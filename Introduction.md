This is a **[[Appendix#TTRPG|TTRPG]]** system for magical girl settings, the players need to juggle fighting the forces of evil with **[[Appendix#Daily Life|daily life]]** stuff to protect both their identity and their community. This rulebook has systems for daily life role playing, **[[Appendix#Investigating Rumors|investigating rumors]]**, tracking down **[[Appendix#enemy hideouts|enemy hideouts]]** and **[[Appendix#Scheme (GM Feature)|schemes]]**, and [[Combat|combat]] (and all it’s sub systems) as well as relevant information for character creation, a **spells** and **actions** list, character growth, and rewards for players at the completion of a mission. Additionally while it doesn’t have an example campaign \[probably put a link to an example campaign I write later here\] it does have examples for how to write an overarching story between individual missions.

The expected format for a play session revolves around learning of rumors of a scheme the forces of evil are playing on the public or specific people, investigating these rumors and finding the truth on if it’s just a fad craze or a real scheme to drain the populace of energy. Then comes storming the lair, confronting the villain of the week and the denouement. While this may seem simple on it’s face, this book should provide the tools to flesh out this process to a meaningful role playing experience.

Some of the language in this rulebook is flowery and poetic to help set the tone for the intended setting, if something isn’t clear check the appendix for a plain language definition of any bolded term in this **rulebook**.
